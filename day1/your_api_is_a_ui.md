**Your API is a UI** by [Christopher Hoult](https://twitter.com/choult)

Eng. lead at DataSift.

Consumer of an API is a user with some very special requirements.

Users are the ultimate consumers of the things that we build.

We need to think about, when building our systems, who we're building them for:

* Developers and colleagues
* Customers
* Their customers
* Applications

What does your API do?

* Use cases
* User stories
* Document usage/flow
* Elevator pitch

You can upfront decide how you're going to approach telling users how to go through your system.  Also think about the "value add".

What can users do?

* Why are you exposing an API?
* It's very rare to expose everything
* Too much complexity --> confusion
* Define restrictions
* Validate user stories against goals
